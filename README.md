## Do you and your group members have a busy schedule and find it hard to make time for the project?
Don't worry about it and just use the **Time-Conflict-Solver-inator**

*Note: name is prone to change*

*Note: yes this is a Phineas and Ferb reference*

What does this inator do?
- Finds common free time between group members.
- Finds available time based on length of activity.
- Uses multiple sessions and finds available time for these sessions.
- Allows for direct input of unavailable time to make it easier to find gaps in busy schedules.

Who can use this inator?
- Anyone that needs group scheduling!   

Why make/use this inator instead of using something else the great Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz has created?
- Because with busy schedules it is easy to overlook small bits for free time. I myself have had this issue.
- Trying to think and plan out schedules is hard without a central/well-made timetable (My calendars aren't in sync). 
- With the app, you don't have to repetitively ask teammates "Are you available at **insert inconvinient time**?" 
- Less thinking about these things means more thinking about better things!
- Maximizes time effieciency for increased inator creating!

Special Details
- Time slots will be seperated into 15 minutes for each day.
- Range for time slots will be limited to 5 days.
