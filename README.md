# Time-Conflict-Solver-inator

## Do you and your group members have a busy schedule and find it hard to make time for the project?
Don't worry about it and just use the **Time-Conflict-Solver-inator**

*Note: name is prone to change*

*Note: yes this is a Phineas and Ferb reference*

**What is this app?**

It's an app that allows any group of people to find common free time between members, it is determined by the length of 
activity which can be split into multiple sessions or multiple activities. The app also uses direct input of unavailable
time to help identify gaps in busy schedules. Furthermore, it is most beneficial to larger groups and people with very 
busy schedules.

**Why make/use this app/inator instead of using something else the great Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz has created?**

Because with busy schedules it is easy to overlook small bits for free time. I myself have had this issue.
Moreover, trying to think and plan out schedules is hard without a central/well-made timetable 
(My calendars aren't in sync). 
With the app, you don't have to repetitively ask teammates "Are you available at **insert inconvenient time**?" 
This means less thinking about these things means more thinking about better things!
Which in turn maximizes time efficiency for increased inator creating!

Special Details
- Time slots will be split into 15 minutes for each day.
